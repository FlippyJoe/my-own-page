          <p class="partTwoText">
            While I love the challenge of making sense of complex data, I found
            myself increasingly drawn to the creative and dynamic world of web

            My career began in retail sales, where I developed a keen ability to
            understand customer needs, provide exceptional service, and drive
            sales growth. Over the years, I honed my skills in communication,
            problem-solving, and relationship-building, which have been
            instrumental in achieving success in the retail industry. Alongside my
            retail career, I pursued studies in data analytics, gaining
            proficiency in statistical analysis, data visualization, and
            data-driven decision-making.

            experiences that can make a real impact. <br />
            Driven by a curiosity for coding and a desire to build impactful
            digital experiences, I embarked on a journey to learn web development.
            Through education and hands-on projects, I have gained proficiency in
            front-end technologies. My background in retail sales and data
            analytics has provided me with a unique advantage in understanding
            user behavior and designing user-centric web solutions.
